# Boogeyman 2 Lab

## Summary

This is the second lab in a series of challenge rooms from TryHackMe. The threat group, Boogeyman, has compromised a company workstation using a phishing email. I need to use a copy of the email and a memory dump of the workstation to assess the impact of the attack.

### Skills Learned

- Investigating an attack from the initial access to the impact  
- Identifying the tactics, techniques, and procedures of a threat group  
- Analysis of macros in Word documents using olevba
- Digital forensics of memory dumps using Volatility
